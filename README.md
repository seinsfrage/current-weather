# current-weather
Allows user to search for and display current weather in any US city (accompanied by weather-appropriate animated graphics). 
I wanted to go beyond weather app made in classroom setting; so I used this as an opportunity to get some more practice using jQuery and HTML Canvas. Call it a basic weather with a dash of pizazz.
